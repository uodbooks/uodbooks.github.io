<i>Initiated</i> and <i>maintained</i> by some junior members of a college in the university, open to everyone, the site mainly hosts <b>prescribed books</b>, <b>course notes</b> for the various course(s) <b><u>(subject to availability of volunteers of the specific discipline)</u></b> offered by the university, and any other topic which the volunteers find it essential to pass onto the fellow/future junior members on a condition that it is <b><u>free from any personal/general opinions</u></b> and is <b><u>homogenous</u></b> (solely comprising of computerised text, not restricted to eBooks/PDFs but applicable to notes and any closely related utility in order to encourage uniformity).

We, the volunteers are motivated by a common objective, which is to <b>serve</b>; to serve the fellow/future junior members of the university. We do not mean to defame or to infringe any entity or it's rights. The books are hosted only for academic purposes and to promote social inclusivity.
