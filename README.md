## Disclaimer cum Statement of Purpose
### (This is tentative; subject to reconstitution)
#### The organisation is NOT affiliated to the college and IS an independent project organisation.<br>
<i>Initiated</i> and <i>maintained</i> by the junior members of the college, the site mainly hosts <b>prescribed books</b>, <b>course notes</b> for the various course(s) <b><u>(subject to availability of volunteers of the specific discipline)</b></u> offered by the college and any other topic which the volunteers find it essential to pass onto the junior/fellow junior/future junior members of the college on a condition that it is <b><u>free from any personal/general opinions</u></b> and is <b><u>homogenous</u></b> (solely comprising of computerised text, not restricted to eBooks/PDFs but applicable to notes and any closely related utility in order to encourage uniformity).

The volunteers are motivated by a common objective which is to <b>serve</b>; to serve the junior/future junior members of the college. They (volunteers) do not mean to defame any entity or to infringe any entity's rights. The books are hosted only for academic purposes and to promote social inclusivity.

We (volunteers) also encourage the junior members to refer to the site as a last resort and not to abuse the site for self-centered purposes/unfair means. As a prevention, the visibilty of the site will be lost temporarily for a week before, on the day and the following two days of both internal and external examinations. This is  subject to the examination schedule of each discipline, and the visibility will be restricted for even longer.

Again, <b>the organisation is NOT affiliated to the college and IS an independent project organisation.</b>
